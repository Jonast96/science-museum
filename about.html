          Come visit the Community Science Museum at Oslogaten 12, Oslo 4312.
          The entrance if free for all, and we also offer special guided tours
          of the museum that leaves every hour. These tours are 70 NOK per
          person and include a handy printed guide of the museum. If you would
          like to organize a guided tour for your group of 6 or more people,
          please contact us to arrange the tour. The museum has wheelchair
          accessibility ramps, as well as audio guides and braille display sings
          for the visually impaired. There is a cafe attached to the museum
          where you can get light lunches, soft drinks, coffee, snacks and more

        <div class="about-info">
          <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
            lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
            different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
            explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
            with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s
            gone home).

        <p class="about-info">
          As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
          places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
          students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
          laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
          inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more about
          our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through
          for a visit.
