            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
            Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
            about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
            constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
            the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

            we currently face including global warming, extinction of species,

            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
            biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
            the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer
            and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
            understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
            history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
            including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
            transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            You can't throw a rock without ... hitting another rock. They're
            everywhere. Rock creates and shapes the Earth's landscape. It forms
            our magnificent mountains, shapes the deepest oceans, and safely
            separates us from the boiling magma beneath our feet! Learn more
            about the amazing volcanoes and how they work by building your own
            volcano and watch it explode!
