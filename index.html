            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.

            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You
            can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact
            us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
